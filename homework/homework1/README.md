Project Title:
Will Coca-Cola (KO) Stocks have positive returns in 5 years?
Stage: Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

Problem Statement:
In long-term investments it is important to assess if the stock's prices will give a positive return. This project will analyze if an investor that buys Coca-Cola (KO) today will receive positive return over a fixed 5-year period under a buy & hold strategy. 
I use public historical data (Yahoo Finance) to evaluate 5-year holding periods across KO’s history and to provide a predictive answer based on an estimate of the probability of a positive outcome.

Stakeholder & User:
Stakeholder: Individual investor or portfolio manager.
User: Investor, portfolio manager.

Decision window: 
Annual review (long-term).

Useful Answer & Decision:
Type: Predictive

Metric: 
Probability estimate through historical records (share of 5-year windows with positive return).

Assumptions & Constraints:
Data: Yahoo Finance daily adjusted close 
Liquidity & capacity
Stationarity: historical data does not guarantee results.

Known Unknowns / Risks:
Regime change
