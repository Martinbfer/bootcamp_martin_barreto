**Subject:** 5-Year Buy & Hold Outlook for Coca-Cola (KO)
**To:** Long-term equity investor / advisor
**From:** Martin Barreto
**Date:** <8/20/2025>

**Decision Context**
Should we allocate (or maintain) a long-only position in Coca-Cola (KO) given a 5-year buy & hold horizon?

**Question**
If we buy KO today, what is the probability that the 5-year total return (using adjusted close as a proxy) is positive?

**Data**
- Source: Yahoo Finance (KO), daily adjusted close (includes dividends & splits).
- Benchmark: SPY (S&P 500 ETF) for context.
- Window: all rolling 5-year periods available in KO’s history.

**Method**
- Construct rolling 5-year returns from adjusted prices.  
- Compute historical hit rate = share of 5-year windows with positive return.  
- Summarize path risk: max drawdown and annualized volatility within windows.   
- Report probability estimate and scenario notes.

**Outputs**
- Binary signal: “Likely Positive?” + probability.
- Tables/plots: distribution of 5-year returns, hit rate over time, drawdowns.
- One-pager with takeaway for allocation.

**Assumptions & Constraints**
- Liquidity and investability of KO remain similar to recent years.
- Adjusted close ≈ total return proxy.
- Stationarity limited; change of regime can occurr.
- Educational—not professional financial advise.

**Risks / Known Unknowns**
- Regime shifts (rates, taxes)
- Path-dependence: drawdowns are possible even with final positive results

**Cadence**
Annual review; update analysis quarterly if desired.
